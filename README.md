# OPENGL_Engine

This is my Game Engine that I have been developing since 2023.

**Tools used**

OpenGL - a Graphics API used to interact with the GPU and used for rendering 2d and 3d graphics. There are a vast amount of resources to learn OpenGL, but I learned mostly from this site: learnopengl.com

GLFW - provides OpenGL with a window in which to render. Also used for keyboard and mouse events. More info here: https://www.glfw.org/

Assimp - an import library I used to import 3d models into my engine.
